\chapter*{Abstract}

The in-medium similarity renormalization group (IM-SRG)
is an \abinitio{} many-body method used to great success
to model medium-mass nuclear systems.
Its computational cost scales polynomially,
and its formalism is highly flexible,
leading to multiple variants that have been developed to extend its original closed-shell
formulation to open-shell systems.

The current state-of-the-art implementations truncate the IM-SRG equations
at the normal-ordered two-body level,
the first non-trivial order in the expansion.
In this work, we seek to systematically study the effects
of extending this truncation to the normal-ordered three-body level,
the so-called IM-SRG(3).
We present the results of the current implementation
for ${}^4\text{He}$ and the pairing Hamiltonian,
calculations done to validate our implementation against previous calculations.
We also discuss the steps still to be taken to
arrive at an implementation that will allow for a careful study of the effects
of the IM-SRG(3) truncation for nuclear systems.
